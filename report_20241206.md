- Need more robust data preprocessing approach to tackle multiple file types, format, language
- document type is kind of bounded (nda, default, agreement) because of the prompt engineering. It's not an issue/bug.
- Need to refine prompt template to get 1 paragraph summarization.

  - Formatting of Word document (likely but need to dig deeper).
  - Language engine
